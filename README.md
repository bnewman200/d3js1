# D3JS 

This a simple Application using D3JS.

The Data used is generated using a PGA Statistics HTML Parser I created [here](https://github.com/bnewman200/pgastats)

The application can be deployed directly using the source folder, but also can be distributed using a minified JavaScript application file.

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Gulp
#### Build

gulp browser-sync
```
#### Distribute
```

gulp browser-sync-dist
```
